## _What is the Yaml?_
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74305823/118442059-09bd3580-b725-11eb-92b7-4e435714bcca.png" width="180"/>  

**Yaml** is a human-readable data-serialization language. And it is commonly used for configuration files and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted. YAML was originally an acronym for '_Yet Another Markup Language_', but is now more commonly referred to as '**_YAML Ain't Markup Language_**'. Visit the [official YAML website](http://yaml.org/) for more information.

      <td>
        YAML has many additional features lacking in JSON, including comments, extensible data types, relational anchors, strings without quotation marks, and mapping types preserving key order.
      </td>
      <td>
        YAML is much more complex compared to TOML - the YAML specification was pointed out to have 23,449 words, while the TOML specification had only 3,339 words.
      </td>
      <td>
        YAML lacks the notion of tag attributes that are found in XML. And YAML itself does not have XML's language-defined document schema descriptors that allow, for example, a document to self-validate. 
      </td>
